# EIRTeam.Steamworks

Steamworks module for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) >4.1 heavily inspired by [Facepunch.Steamworks](https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks).

# Why no GDExtension?

Due to the lack of callable_mp support in GDExtension we cannot support it unless we change a lot of the code, however once https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/pull/1155 is merged a port will be possible.
